Angular/React Developer Code Test

Instructions
Use the Star Wars API swapi.co to generate a list of the films that a particular character appears in.

Build a working example in Codepen.io or Plnkr.co, or a public git repo (GitHub, BitBucket, etc).
Allow users to choose a character from the provided JSON file
Upon selection of a character, the UI should update to display information about each of the films that that character appears in. Minimally: Title, and formatted ('Thursday, May 19 2005') release date
Do this with some kind of component-based pattern
You can only use the API routes found the provided 'characters.json' file, and the data returned from those calls
Don't load the movie data until the character is clicked
Don't show any movie information until all of the character's movies have loaded
Use css to make it pretty, styling is up to you!

Frameworks you can use
Angular 1.x
Angular 2
React

Feel free to use any function library you'd like. If you have feedback about the exercise, please include it.
